   * Fix a buffer overread in DTLS ClientHello parsing in servers with
     MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE enabled. An unauthenticated client
     or a man-in-the-middle could cause a DTLS server to read up to 255 bytes
     after the end of the SSL input buffer. The buffer overread only happens
     when MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN is less than a threshold that depends on
     the exact configuration: 258 bytes if using mbedtls_ssl_cookie_check(),
     and possibly up to 571 bytes with a custom cookie check function.
     Reported by the Cybeats PSI Team.
